When making benchmark tests, ensure your test program is positioned in benchmark-files/

Make sure your file ends with -tests.rs

Make sure that the program uses the output-benchmark module to output the x-axis values for the graph

Make sure the output-benchmark module is used in the main function of the file to output all x-values

Make sure you name your output file the exact same as your test file, which means it too must end in -tests. This is done when using the output-benchmark module

Make sure the program uses benchmark testing with BenchHarness and calls .iter()

NOTICE:
 - I hav made an example called vector-tests.rs which benchmarks vector summing with a vector of increasing size. It works so copy that and you should be fine.
 - To ignore compiling certain tests, simply append ".ingore" to the end of the filename, since the script will look for files ending in "-tests.rs".
 - To ignore compiled test binaries, simply append something to their name, since the script will look for files ending in "-tests".
 - To run the shell script, type "./test-script benchmark" to make it run the benchmark tests and construct the graphs.
 - Each benchmark data point must be its own function with the #[bench] tag.
 - Warnings in our test files about dead code is unavoidable
 
 Good luck ;-)
